Hey, hope you're enjoying 2024 so far!

I'm currently doing a deep dive into algorithmic studies right now, but that hasn't stopped me from pushing forward on larger ongoing projects like Armchair Saber. 
I'm also doing alot of interesting design work for a VR game!

Please reach out if you want to collaborate or if you spot an issue with my code, cheers!
